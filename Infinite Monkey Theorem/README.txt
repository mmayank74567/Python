Infinite Monkey Theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for 
an infinite amount of time will almost surely type a given text, such as complete works of William Shakespeare.

We have now replaced a monkey with a python function. The goal of the function is to generate just one sentence of
Shakespeare. The sentence we are shooting for is 'methinks itis like a weasel'.

In the code, a python function randomnly generates words (a sentence) equivalent in size to that of the sentence 
we are comparing to. Another function checks how close is the randomly generated sentence to the original Shakespeare
sentence.
